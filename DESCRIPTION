Title: Read Tabular Data With Interlaced Values And Missing Reasons
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kyle D. Husmann <kdh38@psu.edu>
Maintainer: Kyle D. Husmann <kdh38@psu.edu>
Description: Tabular data sources often encode values and missing
    reasons into the same textual column. This packages loads such data and
    deinterlaces the tabular source into a dataframe with two columns per 
    variable: one for values, and one for missing reasons. This representation
    provides a tidy and typesafe interface for working with values and missing 
    reasons in R.
