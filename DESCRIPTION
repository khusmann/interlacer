Title: Read Tabular Data With Interlaced Values And Missing Reasons
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person("Kyle", "Husmann", , "kdh38@psu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Textual tabular data sources often encode values and missing
    reasons into the same texkual column. This packages loads such data
    and deinterlaces the tabular source into a dataframe with two columns
    per variable: one for values, and one for missing reasons. This
    representation provides a tidy and typesafe interface for working with
    values and missing reasons in R.
