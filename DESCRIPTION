Title: Read Tabular Data With Interlaced Values And Missing Reasons
Version: 0.4.2
Authors@R: 
    person("Kyle", "Husmann", , "kyle.husmann@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: interlacer provides functions for handling tabular data with interlaced
    missing reasons (e.g., N/A, REFUSED, -99). It introduces a special "interlaced"
    vector type that enables you to keep the values and missing reasons as separate
    "channels" of the same column. This allows you to easily work with a variable's
    values while still preserving its missing reasons for filtering or summary
    statistics.
