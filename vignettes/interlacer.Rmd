Unfortunately, when these are loaded into R with 
functions like `readr::read_csv()` these all become `NA` values and lose the
missing reason. If you want to create samples or calculate statistics connected
to the *reasons* values are missing, you're forced to load your data as raw
character columns and do a bunch of manual string operations to obtain the
information you want.
